        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a PhD Candidate at the <a href="https://cast.caltech.edu/">Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies (CAST)</a> at Caltech, where I primarily work with Professor <a href="https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/mgharib">Morteza Gharib</a>, and Professor  <a href="https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page">Richard M. Murray</a>. 
          
          <br>
          
          <br> My research focuses on developing aerial robots with non-trivial morphologies and a particular emphasis on multi-modal robots capable of dynamic transition between air and ground locomotion. 
          My work draws inspiration from the fields of control theory, robotics, machine learning, optimization, and aerodynamics. 
          I am supported by the <a href="https://www.onassis.org/initiatives/onassis-communities/onassis-scholars-association">Onassis Foundation Scholarship</a>.

          <br>

          <br> Before Caltech, I earned my Master Degree in Mechanical Engineering and Robotics from ETH Zurich in 2020 and a Bachelor Degree in Mechanical Engineering from EPFL in 2018. 
          During my time at ETH Zurich, I was fortunate to work with Professor <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/petros-koumoutsakos">Petros Koumoutsakos</a> on deep reinforcement learning for control of soft swimming bodies. 
          
          <br>

          <br> I have also spent 6 months working as a Robotics Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.anybotics.com/">Anybotics</a> (an ETHZ spinoff) in Zurich. 
          Here I developed novel parameter estimation algorithms to improve walking performance of the quadruped robot Anymal.

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <h2>Multi-Modal Robotics</h2>
        <p>
          Designing and testing multi-modal robots, such as the <strong>Aerially Transforming Morphobot (ATMO)</strong>, capable of dynamically switching between aerial and terrestrial modes.
        </p>
        <img src="gifs/Video1.gif" alt="Dynamic Ground-Aerial Morpho-Transition" class="research-gif">
        <p>
          Mid-air robotic transformation leads to unexpected aerodynamic effects which I analyze using aerodynamic experimental testing and rigorous theory.
          The findings are used to inform the control algorithms for smooth transition behaviours.

        </ul>
        <h2>Soft Robotics</h2>
        <p>
          For soft robots operating in fluid media the time variation of the body shape required to produce favorable behaviours are very complex to uncover using traditional control methods.
          I am working on using AI based methods for learning behaviours of such systems. An example is producing the maximum possible acceleration with a limited energy expenditure in swimming fish robots. 
        </p>
        <img src="gifs/fish-escapes.gif" alt="Demo 1" class="research-gif">
        <p>
          Soft aerial robotics for energetically efficient multi-modal flight. Currently developing a new concept for a flexible surface controlled by thrusters.
          Such a surface can improve agility and crash tolerance, while reducing energetic cost of locomotion.

        </ul>
        <h2>AI for Control</h2>
        <p>
          I am actively investigating how AI can be used for control in situations when the system dynamics are too complex to model and control with standard approaches, 
          and also for robotic explorers with partial information.
